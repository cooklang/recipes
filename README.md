# CookLang community recipes

This is a repository to share community recipes.

## How to download recipes

Simply save recipe file to your local filesystem.

If you have installed [CookCLI](https://cooklang.org/cli/), you can fetch recipes directly from this repository into your recipe book. 

`cook fetch "Baked Potato Soup.cook"`

## How to create recipes

We have a few guidelines for creating recipes for the community repository:

* Do not use images in your recipe.
* Fill out all relevant metadata for your recipe (especially time, author, and servings).
* Always use title case for your file names (e.g. "7 Alarm Chilli.cook" or "Mama's Famous 4-Layer Ice Cream Cake.cook").

## How to contribute

1. At the top-right, click the "Add file" drop-down menu, then click "Upload files". 
2. Drag the recipes you've made into the box (or open the file browser and select your files).
3. Write a description of your recipes.
4. Select the "Create a new branch for this commit" option and name your branch something specific to your recipes.
5. Click "Propose changes".

We manually review all recipes before they're added to the repository so that all recipes meet our quality standards.
