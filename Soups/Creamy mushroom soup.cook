Peel and chop the @potatoes{100%g}, @onions{50%g} and @mushrooms{200%g} into chunks. The potatoes will need to be cut a bit smaller.

Heat a #frying pan{} over a medium heat with a little @oil and saut√© the vegetables until golden. Season with @salt{4%g}, @pepper{1/4%tsp} and chopped fresh @rosemary{1/4%tsp}.

Put the sauted vegetables into a saucepan and pour water over them until just covered. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, then lower the heat and leave at a low simmer until the potatoes are tender.

Remove the soup from the heat and blend with a #blender, add the @double cream{50%g} and @salt to taste. Garnish with freshly cracked black pepper.
