-- This is a lovely, simple recipe that goes with just about anything and is a real crowd pleaser.

Preheat the #oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

Slice your @cabbage{1/2}, it can be roughly done as the cabbage will cook down in the oven. Place in an #oven proof dish{} and sprinkle the @mushroom soup powder{1%packet} over the top. Pour over the @cream{250%ml} and place in the oven.

Keep a check on the cabbage, it will need a stir once in a while. Your dish should be done in about ~{35%minutes}. No seasoning is really necessary as the soup powder is normally quite well seasoned.
