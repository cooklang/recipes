Place the @port{300%ml} and @brown sugar{175%g} into a #pot and allow to boil.

Add the @cranberry jelly{2%tbsp} and gently simmer so that the sauce can reduce, make sure to keep stirring your sauce to stop it catching on the bottom of the pan. The longer you simmer the sauce, the thicker it will get.

This is quite a sweet gravy and so goes well with poultry and potatoes.
