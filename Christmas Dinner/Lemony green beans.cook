Begin by bringing a #pot of water to boil.

Top and tail the @frozen beans{1%packet}.

Once the water is boiling, blanch the beans, just until they turn bright green, then drain the water and put the pot back onto the heat and gently fry the beans with a little @oil, the crushed @garlic{1%clove} and @salt and @pepper to taste.

The beans wonâ€™t need much cooking, lastly add a squeeze of @lemon{1}, this is also to taste, half a lemon may be enough. This is a good accompaniment to roasts.
