-- Pesto
Grate the @Parmesan cheese{20%g} on a fine #grater.

Roast the @pine nuts{10%g} in a dry #pan until they become shiny as the oils realease and you just begin to smell them.

Place the @garlic{1%g}, @parsley{50%g} and @basil leaves{85%g} in the blender bowl and season with @salt{2%g} and @pepper{1/4%tsp}, then blend the ingredients together in the #blender to create a paste.

Dilute the mixture with @olive oil{140%g} and lemon juice to get the consistency you want. Pesto is fantastic with pasta, salads or just on ciabatta bread.
