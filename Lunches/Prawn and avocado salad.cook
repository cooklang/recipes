Cut the @avocado{1/2} in half, remove the stone and carefully peel off the skin. Cut the avocado into slices. A little lemon juice will prevent it going brown if necessary.

Peel the @king prawns{100%g}, heat a #frying pan{} over a medium heat with a little @oil and saut√© the prawns with the @salt, @thyme{1/5%tsp}, @rosemary{1/5%tsp} and chopped @garlic{1%glove}. Should you like chilli you can finely chop one chilli and add to the prawns.

Arrange the avocado on a plate, top with the @rocket salad leaves{20%g}, place the prawns on the rocket salad and drizzle with @lime{30%g} juice and @olive oil{}. This salad makes a lovely, light Summer lunch.
